# 🧠 BlackVault Architecture

This document outlines the structural design of BlackVault, including its modular components, control flow, and inter-system boundaries.

## 🔄 Data Flow (Simplified)

1. **Initialization**  
   - Client SDK initializes handshake  
   - Ephemeral keys are negotiated (X25519)  
   - Unique Session ID is assigned  

2. **Payload Transmission**  
   - Messages are encoded, encrypted, authenticated  
   - Packet includes nonce, signature, and version tag  
   - Validation firewall intercepts any malformed input  

3. **Receiving Side**  
   - Handshake verification → decryption → reassembly  
   - Heuristic modules check for tampering, corruption, and side-channel patterns  
   - If compromised state detected: kill_trigger activates runtime trap

4. **Post-Delivery**  
   - Messages are read into protected ephemeral memory  
   - Optional auto-wipe after TTL (Time To Live) expiration  
   - Vaulted content only persisted under verified context

## 🧱 Core Modules

### `/core/handshake_engine/`
- Manages ephemeral DH exchanges  
- Verifies sender identity using public keys + fingerprint chain  
- Time-bound sessions with expiration thresholds  

### `/core/encryption_layer/`
- AEAD encryption using ChaCha20-Poly1305 or AES-GCM  
- Zero-padding obfuscation  
- Message format versioning for future compatibility  

### `/core/validation_firewall/`
- All inputs pre-parsed and typechecked  
- Fuzz-tested to resist malformed or adversarial packets  
- Triggers alerts if anomaly scores are exceeded  

### `/core/kill_trigger/`
- Executes shutdown or trap routines if unauthorized reads are detected  
- May invoke system-level signals, session wipes, or silent crash

---

## 🛡️ Defense-Specific Components

### `/defense/trap_handlers/`
- Reactive logic for reader mismatch, fingerprint spoofing, or replay  
- Designed to bait reverse engineering tools (e.g. hex dumping, GDB, IDA)

### `/defense/heuristic_detector/`
- Real-time pattern scanning of behavior  
- If hostile patterns emerge, traffic is cut and node hardened

## 🧮 Runtime Modes

| Mode         | Behavior                                                                 |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stealth      | Minimal logs, aggressive timeouts, trap-laced payloads                   |
| Hardened     | Defensive modules fully engaged, anti-tamper + auto-wipe                 |
| Developer    | Debug tracing enabled, trap handlers disabled unless manually activated  |

---

## 📦 Deployment Targets

- Command-line tools  
- Browser-based WASM SDK (planned)  
- Microservice wrapper for enterprise messaging stacks  
- Embedded endpoint clients (low-memory builds planned)

BlackVault was not designed to be polite. It was designed to **outlive the attacker**.

# BlackVault

## Overview
BlackVault is a next-generation secure communication framework designed to protect user data with cutting-edge encryption and proactive defense mechanisms. It introduces a revolutionary "self-defending encryption" concept: if an unauthorized party attempts to intercept or tamper with transmitted data, embedded defensive protocols trigger to shut down the attack vectorâ€”minimizing data leakage and preventing exploitation.

Built for privacy-conscious users, security researchers, and developers, BlackVault aims to set a new standard for resilient, tamper-resistant encrypted communication.

## Key Features
- **Strong cryptography**: Implements Diffie-Hellman key exchange for secure session keys and AES-GCM authenticated encryption for message confidentiality and integrity.
- **Self-defending protocols**: Embedded detection of interception attempts triggers protective measures, such as session termination or alerting mechanisms.
- **Modular architecture**: Clean separation of cryptographic core, session management, and network transport for maintainability and extensibility.
- **Asynchronous networking**: Efficient, scalable, non-blocking communication supporting multiple peers.
- **Comprehensive testing**: Unit tests for cryptographic primitives, session management, transport layer, and encryption to ensure robustness.
- **Open source with Apache 2.0 License**: Encouraging adoption and contribution by the security community.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BryceWDesign/BlackVault.git
   cd BlackVault
   
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
python3 -m venv venv

venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

3. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage Example

from core.crypto.diffie_hellman import DiffieHellman
from core.session_manager.session_manager import SessionManager
from network.transport import TransportLayer

# Create Diffie-Hellman instances for two peers
alice = DiffieHellman()
bob = DiffieHellman()

# Exchange public keys and compute shared secret
alice_secret = alice.compute_shared_secret(bob.get_public_key())
bob_secret = bob.compute_shared_secret(alice.get_public_key())

# Initialize session manager and store session key
session_manager = SessionManager()
peer_id = 'bob'
session_manager.create_session_key(peer_id)

# Initialize transport and send encrypted message
transport = TransportLayer()
# ... connect and send as needed ...

Architecture
core/crypto: Cryptographic primitives including Diffie-Hellman and AES-GCM encryption.

core/session_manager: Manages session keys securely.

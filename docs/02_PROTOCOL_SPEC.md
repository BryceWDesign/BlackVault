# BlackVault Protocol Specification

---

## Overview

BlackVault’s protocol is designed to establish secure, authenticated, and self-defending communication channels that embed reactive defense mechanisms in every packet.

---

## 1. Handshake Protocol

- **Algorithm:** X25519 ECDH ephemeral key exchange  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Client sends ephemeral public key with unique session ID.  
  2. Server responds with its ephemeral public key and nonce.  
  3. Both sides compute shared secret.  
  4. Derive session keys using HKDF-SHA256 with context info.  
  5. Session is authenticated via Ed25519 signatures exchanged during handshake.

- **Timeout:** Handshake must complete within 3 seconds or fail.

## 2. Packet Structure

| Field           | Size (bytes) | Description                         |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| Version         | 1            | Protocol version (currently 1)    |
| Session ID      | 16           | Unique per connection              |
| Packet Type     | 1            | Data, ACK, Control, Trap Signal   |
| Payload Length  | 2            | Length of encrypted payload        |
| Payload         | Variable     | Encrypted data                    |
| MAC             | 16           | Poly1305 authentication tag       |

---

## 3. Encryption & Authentication

- **Cipher:** ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD  
- **Key Rotation:** Session keys rotate every 10,000 packets or 15 minutes  
- **Padding:** Variable-length padding randomized per packet to foil size analysis  
- **MAC:** Poly1305 ensures integrity and authenticity  

---

## 4. Trap & Kill Signal Packets

- Special packet types that trigger defense mechanisms on detection of unauthorized access  
- Embedded payloads carry precompiled kill-trigger instructions or trap handlers  
- Must be processed atomically to prevent tampering  

---

## 5. Versioning & Compatibility

- Protocol versions indicated in Version byte  
- Older clients reject packets with unknown version  
- Forward-compatible design allows optional fields in payload  

---

## 6. Error Handling

- Malformed packets cause immediate connection termination  
- Repeated anomalies trigger kill switch routines  
- All error events logged locally with strict limits to avoid side-channel leaks

---

## 7. Extensions

- Future support planned for quantum-resistant key exchange  
- Optional multi-factor handshake using physical tokens or biometrics

---

## Summary

BlackVault’s protocol balances cutting-edge cryptographic primitives with practical, layered defense strategies—ensuring not just secrecy, but active denial of unauthorized access.

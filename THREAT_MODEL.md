# 🛡️ BlackVault Threat Model

BlackVault is engineered for hostile environments. This document outlines the threat actors, attack surfaces, and design choices made to neutralize or mitigate those threats.

---

## 🎯 Target Audience

BlackVault is designed for:

- Activists, whistleblowers, and journalists in high-risk zones  
- Developers building tamper-proof communication systems  
- Enterprises requiring verifiable, encrypted, and trace-resistant messaging

---

## 🧨 Primary Threat Actors

1. **State-level Surveillance Agencies**  
   - Mass packet sniffing  
   - Protocol downgrades  
   - Certificate forgery (root store attacks)

2. **Malware Operators**  
   - Remote code injection  
   - File interception at rest  
   - Credential scraping

3. **Black Hat Hackers / APT Groups**  
   - Custom toolkits (e.g., Cobalt Strike, Metasploit)  
   - Side-channel attacks  
   - Reverse engineering attempts

4. **Insider Threats**  
   - Compromised developers  
   - Internal tools leaking crypto materials

---

## 🔓 Attack Surfaces

- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) during handshake/initiation  
- Replay attacks on stored or intercepted packets  
- Tampering with encrypted payloads to trigger faults  
- Memory scraping of decrypted content  
- Parsing-based denial-of-service vectors

## 🧬 Key Design Defenses

| Attack Type           | Defense Strategy                                                                 |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Packet sniffing       | Ephemeral key exchange, forward secrecy (X25519/ECDHE)                          |
| Tampering             | Authenticated encryption (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305)                           |
| Replay injection      | Unique session IDs, nonces, and timestamp checks                                |
| Payload corruption    | Strict message validation + failsafe zero-read routines                         |
| Signature spoofing    | Double-validation (sender identity + crypto handshake fingerprinting)           |
| Parser DoS            | Hardened binary message format + size-throttling + fuzz-tested decoder logic     |
| Client hijacking      | Optional runtime traps + terminal kill-switch triggers for unauthorized readers |

## ⚙️ Optional Defensive Features (Experimental)

- Self-terminating payload segments if header mismatch occurs  
- Data that becomes **opaque garbage** if not accessed via verified chain  
- Embedded "honey frames" meant to **corrupt reverse engineering workflows**  
- Auto-blacklisting reader agents that fail decryption 3x in succession

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

BlackVault assumes breach is inevitable. We focus on **minimizing impact, isolating exposure, and making every unauthorized read self-defeating**.

The enemy is always smarter than you think. We build like they’re watching — because they are.

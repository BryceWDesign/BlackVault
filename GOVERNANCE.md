# ðŸ§­ Project Governance â€“ BlackVault

BlackVault is a mission-oriented, high-integrity open source project. To maintain clarity, authority, and trust, the following governance model applies:

---

## ðŸ‘‘ Project Leadership

**Lead Maintainer:**  
- Bryce W. (Founder)  
- Final say on all architectural decisions  
- Security authority for tamper defense and encryption systems

**Core Maintainers:**  
- Trusted contributors with direct write access  
- Vote on major features, refactors, and deprecations  
- Can merge PRs that meet quality and security requirements

---

## ðŸš¦ Decision Making

Decisions follow a **meritocratic consensus** model:

- Trivial fixes (typos, formatting): Fast-track via PR
- Features/Refactors: PR + discussion + approval from 2 maintainers
- Breaking changes or defense-layer rewrites: Requires Lead Maintainer sign-off

If consensus cannot be reached, **Lead Maintainer decides**.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Becoming a Maintainer

Contributors may be invited to become maintainers after:

- Submitting 5+ high-quality PRs that are merged
- Demonstrating code ownership, respectful collaboration, and architectural understanding
- Participating in project discussions and reviewing othersâ€™ code

Maintainers can be **demoted or removed** if:

- Inactive for 90+ days (unless communicated)
- Repeatedly violate code standards or community rules
- Bypass security review procedures

---

## ðŸ§ª Security Power Override

Any maintainer can flag a PR or commit as `SECURITY OVERRIDE REQUIRED`. This temporarily halts merging until reviewed by the Lead Maintainer, even if consensus is reached.

---

## ðŸ§± Subproject Autonomy

Any core module (e.g., protocol, client SDK, defense engine) may have a **sub-lead** responsible for its roadmap and merges, subject to the same security rules and governance.

We build **public safety tech** â€” and we govern it accordingly.

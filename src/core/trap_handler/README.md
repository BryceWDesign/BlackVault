# Trap Handler Module

## Overview

The Trap Handler is responsible for detecting unauthorized access attempts and activating defensive countermeasures, including safe shutdown and communication disruption mechanisms.

Key functions include:

- Monitoring for protocol violations or suspicious behavior during handshake and data exchange  
- Triggering kill-switch routines that safely zero out sensitive keys and halt processes  
- Logging events locally with tamper-evident audit trails  
- Integrating with external monitoring or alert systems  
- Supporting configurable response actions, e.g., shutdown, alerts, or decoys

---

## Architecture

- Central `TrapHandler` class managing detection and response  
- Event-driven design to listen for signals from handshake, encryption, or network layers  
- Thread-safe operation to avoid race conditions during shutdown sequences

---

## Usage Example

```python
from trap_handler import TrapHandler

trap = TrapHandler()
trap.register_event('handshake_violation', trap.trigger_kill_switch)

# Later in handshake logic:
if violation_detected:
    trap.emit_event('handshake_violation')

# Monitoring Module

## Overview

The Monitoring module continuously observes network traffic, protocol exchanges, and system behavior to identify potential threats or unauthorized access attempts.

Key features include:

- Real-time analysis of handshake and data packets  
- Detection of protocol violations, malformed messages, and replay attempts  
- Anomaly detection using heuristics and behavioral baselines  
- Integration with the Trap Handler for event triggering  
- Configurable thresholds for alert sensitivity  
- Logging and reporting suspicious events for audit and forensic analysis

---

## Architecture

- Central `Monitor` class manages sensors and detectors  
- Works asynchronously to minimize impact on communication throughput  
- Provides interfaces to subscribe to detected events and alerts

---

## Usage Example

```python
from monitor import Monitor
from trap_handler import TrapHandler

trap = TrapHandler()
monitor = Monitor(trap)

monitor.start_monitoring()

# Monitor will emit events to TrapHandler upon suspicious activity
